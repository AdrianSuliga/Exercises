SPOJ_exercise_3_HOT

Details:

In this exercise we have to find the best way for the bus driver to choose so that the costs are as small as it is possible. In first line of input we are given a number 
dist and number h. Dist is the total length of the route and h is a number of petrol stations along the way. In the next h lines of input we are given numbers distances
and costs in each line which represent distance of petrol station (measured from the beggining of the road) and the cost of using them. We know that the bus has to refuel
every 800 km.

This exercise was solved using Dijkstra algorithm which allows you to find the most efficient way to travel through the graph.
