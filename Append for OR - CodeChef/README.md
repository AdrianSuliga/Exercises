# Append for OR - CodeChef exercise

In this exercise you need to learn about bitwise operation OR. You are given numbers N, Y and an array of int numbers [ a1, a2, ..., aN ]. You have to find number X
such that:

(a1 OR a2 OR ... OR aN OR X) == Y

In my solution I used two functions, XOR - which calculates (a1 OR a2 OR ... OR aN) and function minimum_X which finds minimum value of X that we are looking for.

Detailed description is in main.cpp file.
