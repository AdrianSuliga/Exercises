# Exercises
During my educational jurney I often attempt various programming exercises from sites like SPOJ (polish version), CodeChef or LeetCode. This repository contains my description and (mostly) solutions for more interesting ones. Each folder consists of one .cpp file with my solution (or attempt to do one) and README.md file where I describe the exercise and hardships it cost me.
