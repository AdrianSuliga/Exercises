# SPOJ_exercise_2_date_to_binary
My solution for exercise from SPOJ

Details:

In this exercise there are two types of inputs to handle:

1) You are given a date in format YYYY-MM-DD (for example 1990-11-23). You have to convert it into a binary sequence which consists of 16 bits. First 7 of them represent a year, 4 of them - a month and the last 5 - a day. Years are counted since 1980.

2) You are given a binary sequence such as one described above. You have to convert it into a date which is in format YYYY-MM-DD.
