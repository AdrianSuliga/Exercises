# SPOJ
During my educational jurney I often try to do exercises from polish version of SPOJ. This repository contains my description and (mostly) solutions for more interesting
ones. Each folder consists of one .cpp file with my solution (or attempt to do one) and README.md file where I describe the exercise and hardships it cost me.
